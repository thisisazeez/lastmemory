Django Report Engine provides a reporting framework for Django 1.3+. Its goal
is to be lightweight, provide multiple output formats, easily integrate into
existing applications, and be open ended to both direct SQL reports, ORM based
reports, or any other type of report imaginable. It is also attempting to be
reasonably batteries-included with some basic Date based filtering assumptions,
and simple namespacing of reports.

Reports are assumed to be tabular, with additional key/value "aggregates". A
special form can be used to provide filtering/querying controls. There are
premade filtering controls/framework to assist. Existing shortcut queryset and
SQL based forms are integrated and can be quickly extended for generic reports.
CSV, XML and HTML exports are included.
